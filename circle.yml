#   # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
#   # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
#   # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
#   sample:
#     jobs:
#       - build-and-test
#       # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
#       # - node/test
